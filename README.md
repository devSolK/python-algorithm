# Python Algorithm Study.

currently studying BT/BST.

This repo is my personal archive.

```
git pull --rebase
```

### Note:
```
# NOTE:
#     What if iterative?
#     What if recursive?
#     What if no helper function allowed?
#     Is this BFS? or DFS? (traversal)
#     Time complexity (when balanced / not balanced)
```
